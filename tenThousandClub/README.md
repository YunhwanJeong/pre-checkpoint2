# tenThousandClub

Write a function, tenThousandClub, that takes in an array of information, salesTeam, and returns an array that lists the full names of each member of the sales team that has sales greater than $10,000.
Make sure the first and last names are separated by a space.

Hint: I recommend you write a helper function, salesToNumber, that converts the sales string to a number.
Feel free to look up parseInt() and slice() on MDN if you don't remember how they work.

- output: an array that lists the full names of each member of 10,000 club
